# 🎥 MENU_ACE_CG-Advanced_Monitor_ARMA3
## Introduction

As soon as I finish (if I ever manage to 😅) the full ACE menu, I will also create a version with the **scroll wheel menu**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The script must be **inserted in the `init` field of a game logic** and **synchronized with the desired monitors**.  
Once active, it allows interaction through the **ACE menu** to control multiple monitoring features.

---

### 🎥 Select Operator
This option allows you to display on the monitor any operators equipped with a **helmet cam**  
(from the *cTab NSWDG Edition* mod — required item: `IteamcTabHCam`).

This makes it possible to **monitor field operations in real time**.  
Additionally:
- Players **undercover** are shown **with their name in purple**.  
- Players in the **BLUFOR faction** are shown **in blue**.

---

### 🔭 Select Spotter
Allows you to connect to the view of operators using one of the following **binoculars or optical devices**:


> *The “Nikon” and “Smartphone” models are part of the **Hate's Digital Camera** mod.*

This feature allows:
- **Remote observation** of the battlefield.  
- **Tactical reconnaissance** before reaching the operational area.

It is mainly designed for those who enjoy **undercover or recon operations**, allowing HQ operators to prepare better for the upcoming situation.

---

### ✈️ Select Drone
This option opens a window that displays **the UAV turret’s camera view**.  
> ⚠️ Note: the drone view still needs adjustments — high altitude can cause terrain rendering issues due to view distance limitations.

---

### 🌙 Change Vision
Available in all modes (Spotter / Drone / Operator).  
Allows toggling **Night Vision ON/OFF** directly via the ACE menu.

---

## 🧰 FIX

- [ ] Improve **binocular rendering** on monitors.  
- [ ] Increase **PiP view distance** for UAV turret feeds.  
- [ ] Refine **drone view** rendering at high altitude.  
- [ ] Add the **scroll wheel menu version**.
